 Position: AA190 - Independent Research
 Principal Investigator: Dr. Ilan Kroo
 Hours/Week: 15
MIT (50 words):
Researched turbofan noise mitigation techniques to reduce Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) for aircraft pass-by. Developed a dynamic model to predict takeoff noise across a spatial mesh for a variety of engine families based on climb performance. Findings highlighted how procedural changes and aircraft configuration reshape community noise exposure.

Researched turbofan noise mitigation techniques to reduce Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) for aircraft pass-by. Developed a dynamic model to predict takeoff acoustic pollution across a spatial mesh based on climb performance profiles. Findings highlighted how procedural changes, aircraft configuration, and engine characteristics reshape community noise exposure. Prototyped ways to integrate findings to inform noise-abatement strategies.
2. Aircraft Aerodynamics and Design Group - Joined-Wing Aircraft
Location: Stanford, CA
 Dates: 09/2023 – 06/2025
 Position: Undergraduate Researcher
 Principal Investigator: Dr. Ilan Kroo
 Hours/Week: 15
Description:
MIT (50 words):
Coded a vortex-lattice model coupled with a finite element method to investigate joined-wing aircraft. Performed parameter sweeps with structural and trim constraints, to explore the design space. I subsequently implemented a gradient-based optimizer to refine geometry and improve cruise performance, demonstrating the interconnected load-sharing and wing-wing interaction benefits.

Coded a vortex-lattice model coupled with a finite element method to investigate joined-wing aircraft. After performing a parameter sweep with structural and trim constraints, I applied a gradient-based optimizer to refine geometry for cruise conditions, revealing strong load-sharing characteristics and wing-wing interaction benefits. The study demonstrated how joint placement, wing-to-tail area, and span ratios, among others, directly influence overall aerodynamic and structural performance.



3. Aerospace Design Laboratory - AAM Aero Performance & Noise
Location: Stanford, CA
 Dates: 09/2025 –
 Position: Graduate Researcher
 Principal Investigator: Dr. Juan Alonso
 Hours/Week: 20
Description:
MIT (50 words):
Developing a multi-fidelity workflow that uses a viscous vortex particle method to capture unsteady velocity and pressure fields for rotor-wing configurations. These fields drive a Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings solver to predict far-field acoustic propagation. Generated datasets train a surrogate model to deliver rapid predictions for aerodynamic performance and noise.

Developing a multi-fidelity workflow that uses a viscous vortex particle method to capture unsteady velocity and pressure fields for a large dataset of rotor-wing configurations. These flow fields drive a Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings solver to predict far-field acoustics. The generated data trains a surrogate model to deliver rapid and physically accurate noise predictions, allowing for the exploration of design spaces that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive or time consuming.
