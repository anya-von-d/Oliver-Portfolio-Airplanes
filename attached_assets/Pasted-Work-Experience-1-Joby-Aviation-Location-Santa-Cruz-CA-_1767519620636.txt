Work Experience

1. Joby Aviation
Location: Santa Cruz, CA
 Dates of Experience: 06/2025 – 
 Position/Title: Flight Test Engineering Intern
 Industry: —
 Hours/Week: 40
Description:
Authored flutter and envelope-expansion test plans for the Joby S4-2.1a to verify simulation data, directly supporting certification efforts. Worked on developing a more accurate return-to-base battery estimate based on existing flight data and mission profiles. Built and validated automated scripts for configuring strain-gauge networks in propeller-vibration measurement systems.
Reason for Leaving:
Full time in the summer, part-time since September.
2. Stanford University
Location: Stanford, CA
 Dates of Experience: 09/2024 – 03/2025
 Position/Title: Course Assistant: AA146A/B – Aircraft Design
 Industry: —
 Hours/Week: 10
Description:
As the sole TA, I developed a suite of scripts that integrated flight dynamics and control theory, providing students with course material to aid them in designing a dynamic-soaring vehicle. I also guided students to refine their decision-making skills through practical application.
Reason for Leaving:
End-of-course offering for the 2024-2025 year.

3. Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation
Location: Savannah, GA
 Dates of Experience: 06/2024 – 09/2024
 Position/Title: Flight Dynamics/Control Law Intern
 Industry: —
 Hours/Week: 40
Description:
Developed code as well as SIMULINK models to validate G400 CLAW linear models for first flight - delivered associated transfer functions and state-space matrices. Improved the analysis scripts by implementing a model to identify the aircraft’s current flight envelope based on flight conditions and key operational parameters. Wrote the G400 Pitch AP and Alternate Mode Linear Analysis Reports for the FAA. Also produced roll mixture scheduling data for the Alternate Mode flight envelope.
Reason for Leaving:
 End of internship.

4. Daher–Kodiak Aircraft Company
Location: Sandpoint, ID
 Dates of Experience: 08/2023 – 09/2023
 Position/Title: Aircraft Engineering Intern
 Industry: —
 Hours/Week: 40
Description:
Used CAD to develop a fire-lab fixture for certifying coupons under 60-Hz vibration, 2000 F flame, and pressure. Subsequently, I created the component schematics and communicated with suppliers to have articles manufactured. Additionally, I assisted with aerodynamic analysis to reduce vibrations of the landing strut assembly’s anti-icing panels for the Kodiak-900. Finally, I worked on validating the latest update for the Garmin NXi G1000 flight deck and integrated the software in X-Plane for testing.
Reason for Leaving:
 End of internship.

5. DroneUp
Location: Virginia Beach, VA
 Dates of Experience: 06/2023 – 07/2023
 Position/Title: Aerospace Innovations Intern
 Industry: —
 Hours/Week: 40
Description:
Developed a Hardware-in-the-Loop modular test bench for the Watts PRISM Sky 3 drone. The test bench I created determines the operational status of individual components in zero-trust environments after drone crashes. I used the open-source JMAVSim simulation environment to custom-code a solution that utilizes the PX4 suite to enable integration for simulated flights within the company’s native Auterion Mission Control software. Additionally, I developed risk-mitigation techniques for parachute deployment.
Reason for Leaving:
 End of internship.

6. WindBorne Systems
Location: Mountain View, CA
 Dates of Experience: 06/2022 – 08/2022
 Position/Title: Aerospace Engineering Intern
 Industry: —
 Hours/Week: 40
Description:
Conceptually designed and manufactured an autonomous drone optimized for flying at low airspeeds. Listed as inventor on patent. Using the CFD data I accumulated based on my design’s sizing, I developed a parametrized simulation environment to validate the drone’s flight properties. I generated the individual components for the aircraft’s assembly in CAD. I iteratively improved the design based on manufacturing feedback to converge on an optimal solution. 
Reason for Leaving:
 End of internship.
